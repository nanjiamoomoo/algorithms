    /**
     * There is an array of positive integers, in which each integer represents a piece of Pizzaâ€™s size, you and your friend take turns to pick pizza from either end of the array. You will pick first. Your friend follows a simple strategy: He will always pick the larger one he could get during his turn. The winner is the one who gets the larger total sum of all pizza. Return the max amount of pizza you can get.
     * Assumption: If during your friend's turn, the leftmost pizza has the same size as the rightmost pizza, he will pick the rightmost one.
     * Examples:
     *  Input: [2,1,100,3]
     *  Output: 102
     * Explanation: To win the game, you pick 2 first, then your friend will pick either 3, after that you could pick 100. In the end you could get 2 + 100 = 102, while your friend could only get 1 + 3 = 4.
