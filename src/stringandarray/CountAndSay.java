     * 11 is "two 1s" so 21.
     * 21 is "one 2 followed by one 1" so 1211.

     * n starts from 1, the first number is "1", the second number is "11"
     * n is smaller than 30

     * @param n

            how to interpret the string
            e.g. 111221 -> 312211

            basically the problem is to encode string by counting duplicate characters
