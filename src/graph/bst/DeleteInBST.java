             case 3: there are both child
                     3.1:  if the right child has no left subtree, Then the root.right is the smallest larger candidate. we connect the root.right.left = root.left, return root.right
                     3.2: if the right child has left subtree, we will have to the find the smallest larger element on the left subtree
                            after we find it, if the smallest larger element has right tree, we connect the right subtree to the left of the parent of the smallest larger
                            if the smallest larger element has no right tree, we can just connect its left = root.left, its right = root.right, return the smallest larger
