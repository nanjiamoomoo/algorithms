                we can imagine this as a 2D array, the row represents the index in one array, the col represents the index in the other array
                the value is the sum of elements in two arrays. We can use i represents the row and j represents the col
                   j
                   4  8  9
            i   1  5  9  10
            i   3  7  11 12
                4  8  12 13
                10 14 18  19
              the smallest sum is when i = 0, and j = 0, which is 1 + 4 = 5
              the next potential smallest sum is i = 1, j = 0 or i = 0, j = 1
              if the current smallest sum is at <i, j>
                the sum at <i + 1ï¼Œ j> < i, j + 1> could potentially be the next smallest.
