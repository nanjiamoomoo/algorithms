     * Given a encoded string that compressed according to the following rules:
     *
     * N[inner_pattern] -> N is a positive integer and the inner pattern will be repeated N times.
     *
     * Decompress the encoded string and return the original string
     *
     * Assumption:
     * N is alway positive integer.
     * The input is always valid, i.e. the brackets are always in pair.
     * The decompressed string (that is the return value) doesn't contain digit or brackets, which means digit, '[' and ']' are only used in encoded (compressed) string.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: "abc"
     * Output: "abc"
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: "ab3[cd[2e]]f"
     * Output: "abcdeecdeecdeef"
     *
     * @param input
     * @return
